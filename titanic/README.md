The Titanic data set is described by Frank Harrell [in the Vanderbilt Biostats
Wiki](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/twiki/pub/Main/DataSets/titanic.html).  It goes
back to work by Earon and Haas (1994), based on work edited by Michael Findlay, and
further work by Robert Dawson.  Details of data set are in Simonoff (1997)

And extended data set `titanic3` was prepared by Cason.

The data is available via the `getHdata()` function in the [Hmisc
package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Hmisc) by Harrell which downloads and provides
them.  As they are save as compressed R data file, we also save them here for convenience
as `titanic.csv`, `titanic2.csv`, and `titanic3.csv`.

Another filtered subset is in the [earth
package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=earth) as data set `etitanic` (where 'e'
stands for the `earth` package).

The file `stanford_titanic` is from [CS109 at
Stanford](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs109/cs109.1166/problem12.html)
as mentioned in the lecture notes.
